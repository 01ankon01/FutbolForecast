# Project Title

## Introduction
This project focuses on [insert brief project goal]. It uses various machine learning and computer vision techniques such as object detection, clustering, and movement analysis. The project is designed to handle real-world problems, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced engineers.

## Key Features
- **Object Detection**: Using [model] to detect and track key elements in the scene.
- **Clustering**: Applying [method] for segmentation and categorization based on visual features.
- **Movement Tracking**: Utilizing [technique] to capture object movement in terms of speed and distance.
- **Transformation**: Implementing perspective adjustments to calculate actual distances and other metrics.

## Modules Used
This project incorporates the following key modules:
- [1]: Use ultralytics and YOLOv8 to detect objects in images and videos.
- [2]: Fine tune and train your own YOLO on your own custom dataset.
- [3]: Use KMeans to cluster pixles and segment players from the background to get the t-shirt color accurately.
- [4]: Use optical flow to measure the camera movement.
- [5]: Use CV2's (opencv) perspective transformation to represent the scene's depth and perspective.
- [6]: Measure player's speed and distance covered in the image.
